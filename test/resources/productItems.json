    "description": "Our Australian artisanal gin, distilled with lemon myrtle and pepperberry, offers a smooth and aromatic taste of native botanicals.",
    "longDescription": "Introducing our latest creation, an Australian artisanal gin made with the native ingredients of lemon myrtle and pepperberry. Our small batch gin is carefully crafted to bring you the unique flavours of these native botanicals that are only found in Australia.\nThe lemon myrtle is a leafy plant that grows in the subtropical rainforests of Australia, known for its intense lemony scent and flavour. It has been used by indigenous Australians for thousands of years for its medicinal and culinary properties. The pepperberry, on the other hand, is a small fruit that grows on the Tasmanian pepper tree, a native plant to Tasmania. It is known for its complex, fruity flavour, and is often used as a substitute for traditional black pepper.\nAt our distillery, we use a carter head still, carefully timing the addition and removal of different botanicals throughout the run to achieve a perfect balance of flavours. We use fresh lemon myrtle leaves, carefully sourced from local farmers who grow them sustainably, and the leaves of the pepperberry plant, which impart a delicate, fruity note to the gin. Our unique distillation process allows us to extract the full flavour and aroma of the botanicals, resulting in a gin that is smooth, aromatic and well-balanced.\nOur lemon myrtle and pepperberry gin is best enjoyed in a classic gin and tonic, with a twist of lemon or lime to enhance the citrus notes of the lemon myrtle. It can also be used as a base for a variety of cocktails, such as a herbaceous martini or a refreshing gin fizz. The possibilities are endless, and we encourage you to experiment with different mixers and garnishes to find your perfect serve.\nAs an artisanal gin, we produce only a limited quantity of each batch, ensuring that every bottle is of the highest quality and full of flavour. Our commitment to using native Australian ingredients and sustainable production methods also ensures that our gin is not only delicious, but also environmentally responsible.\nIn summary, our lemon myrtle and pepperberry gin is a unique and delicious addition to any gin-lover's collection. With its carefully crafted distillation process and perfect balance of flavours, it is a gin that truly stands out from the rest. Try it today and experience the taste of Australia in a glass.",
