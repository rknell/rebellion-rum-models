# Rebellion Rum Models - Build Rules
We don't need explictToJson as its a setting in build.yaml

# JSON Serialization Rules
- Always use the ObjectIdConverter from json_helpers.dart for MongoDB ObjectId fields
- Never use toHexString() for ObjectId conversion, use oid property instead
- Do not add explicitToJson to individual models as it's set globally in build.yaml
